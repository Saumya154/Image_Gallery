# Image_Gallery
1: I have added snapshot of the process that I performed in "Steps images" folder.
2: In "Test cases for saving Images to local File System.xlsx" I have written the test cases.
3: ImageGallery.cs and ImageItem.cs contains the code.
4: I have downloaded Grapecity component with 30-days trial.

I have followed all the steps of Image gallery application guide.
I have never learnt C# .Net before but still I have tried and gave my full efforts for this application.
